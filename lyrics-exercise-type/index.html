	<h1>thank u, next</h1> 
	<h2>by Ariana Grande</h2> <br>

Thought I'd end up with Sean <br>
But he wasn't a match<br>
Wrote some songs about Ricky<br>
Now I listen and laugh<br>
Even almost got married<br>
And for Pete, I'm so thankful<br>
Wish I could say, <em>"thank you"</em> to Malcolm<br>
'Cause he was an angel<br>
<br>
One taught me love<br>
One taught me patience<br>
And one taught me pain<br>
Now, I'm so amazing<br>
I've loved and I've lost<br>
But that's not what I see<br>
So, look what I got<br>
Look what you taught me<br>
And for that, I say<br>
<br>
Thank you, next <em>(next)</em><br>
Thank you, next <em>(next)</em><br>
Thank you, next<br>
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex<br>
Thank you, next <em>(next)</em><br>
Thank you, next <em>(next)</em><br>
Thank you, next <em>(next)</em><br>
I'm so fuckin'<br>
<br>
Spend more time with my friends<br>
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'<br>
Plus, I met someone else<br>
We havin' better discussions<br>
I know they say I move on too fast<br>
But this one gon' last<br>
'Cause her name is Ari<br>
And I'm so good with that <em>(so good with that)</em><br>
<br>
She taught me love <em>(love)</em><br>
She taught me patience <em>(patience)</em><br>
How she handles pain <em>(pain)</em><br>
That shit's amazing <em>(yeah, she's amazing)</em><br>
I've loved and I've lost <em>(yeah, yeah)</em><br>
But that's not what I see <em>(yeah, yeah)</em><br>
'Cause look what I've found <em>(yeah, yeah)</em><br>
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say<br>
<br>
Thank you, next <em>(thank you, next)</em><br>
Thank you, next <em>(thank you, next)</em><br>
Thank you, next <em>(thank you)</em><br>
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex<br>
