	Aesthetics:<br>
1. Images look great, good choice of illustrations with open space for text. <br>

2. I reccomended pulling from the original illustrations for color swatches for the text to maintain aesthetic consistency.<br>

Structure:<br>
1. Nice, readable font size for quote text.<br>

2. Maybe consider making "George Orwell" smaller for hierarchy. <br>

3. Look at the paragraph edge and think about how it interacts with them image. <br>

Technical:<br>
1. Consider which parts of the image would be less contrasting with the text when zooming in/out.<br>
