1. Add more photos so it isn't so text heavy throughout. <br>
2. Make sure all the font sizes really contrast one another to establish hierarchy.<br>
3. Make sure body text is readable.<br>
4. Keep the width of text boxes consistent throughout.<br>
5. Maybe use a more readable, sans-serif font.<br>
