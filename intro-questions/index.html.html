<h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
	<em>1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</em> <br>
 	Louisa Judge, Junior, Double Major in WGSS and Communication Design  <br>
 <br>

	<em> 2. Tell me a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</em><br>	
	I started taking design courses just for fun my first year, and had never done any sort of digital design previously. I loved the material, <br> and eventually added a second major in Communication Design. This class is a requirement for the second major, but even if it wasn't, <br> I would've taken it just to learn these basic web design skills.<br>
<br>

	<em>3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell me a bit about it.</em><br>
	I have absolutely no experience with HTML/CSS/JS! But I am excited to learn. <br>
<br>

<em>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</em><br>
Learning how to make a web user's experience more effecient and enjoyable!<br>
<br>

<em>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</em><br>
The mindset of a user/viewer is very different, I imagine that the pace of a web user is much faster and more impatient than that of a print user/viewer. <br>
<br>

<em>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</em><br>
I think that <a href="https://follain.com/">Follain</a> utilizes effective design because it represents the company's brand extremely well, which is clean, simple, and fresh.<br>
<br>

<em>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</em><br>
I think that <a href="https://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> has a very effective website, because it represents the variety of resources NPR has (news, podcasts, etc.) without making the site <br>feel too busy. It also easily directs users to their local NPR site current broadcast. <br>

<br>

<em>8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</em> <br>
I think that the <a href="https://www.gimletmedia.com/">Gimlet Media</a> wesite works well because it is both stylized and easy to use. It distinguishes itself from most podcast/radio sites by having <br> a beautiful visuals and a clean layout. It utilizes icons to kind of brand each of their separate podcasts and distinguish them.
