<b>From Patrick:</b><br>
1. For the ingredients section, it would make it easier on the eye if they were not centered on the page, but rather arranged in an unordered list.<br>
2. For the instructions section, I would split it into more than two steps. The body of text for each step is significant and would benefit from splitting it off into different steps.<br>

<b>From Micheala:</b><br>

Second and third photo are slightly off center<br>

For ingredients- need bullet points or something or else the text runs together<br>

Break step two up into paragraphs. Its a lot of text in one place without a break. Same with step 3<br>

A little confused about your text hierarchy. It seems like it isnâ€™t consistent <br>
