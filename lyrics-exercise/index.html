	<h1>thank u, next</h1> 
	<h2>by Ariana Grande</h2> <br>

Thought I'd end up with Sean <br>
But he wasn't a match<br>
Wrote some songs about Ricky<br>
Now I listen and laugh<br>
Even almost got married<br>
And for Pete, I'm so thankful<br>
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm<br>
'Cause he was an angel<br>
One taught me love<br>
One taught me patience<br>
And one taught me pain<br>
Now, I'm so amazing<br>
I've loved and I've lost<br>
But that's not what I see<br>
So, look what I got<br>
Look what you taught me<br>
And for that, I say<br>
Thank you, next (next)<br>
Thank you, next (next)<br>
Thank you, next<br>
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex<br>
Thank you, next (next)<br>
Thank you, next (next)<br>
Thank you, next (next)<br>

Spend more time with my friends<br>
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'<br>
Plus, I met someone else<br>
We havin' better discussions<br>
I know they say I move on too fast<br>
But this one gon' last<br>
'Cause her name is Ari<br>
And I'm so good with that (so good with that)<br>
She taught me love (love)<br>
She taught me patience (patience)<br>
How she handles pain (pain)<br>
That shit's amazing (yeah, she's amazing)<br>
I've loved and I've lost (yeah, yeah)<br>
But that's not what I see (yeah, yeah)<br>
'Cause look what I've found (yeah, yeah)<br>
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say<br>
Thank you, next (thank you, next)<br>
